# The Combined Forecasting Model For Time Series 

In this work, I want to reproduce my bachelor thesis work into a Python version and describe it in English

## Objectives
This work wants to improve the accuracy of housing price prediction using a combined model that integrates the advantages of both ARIMA and NN models.

## Method
1. Univariate Time-series prediction via Neural Network (NN) in TensorFlow.
2. Univariate Time-series prediction via Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) in statsmodels
